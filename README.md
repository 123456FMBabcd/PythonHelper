# PythonHelper
# This is PythonHelper, a project to help python beginners.
Because I got caught in the rain when I was first learning python, I wanted to hold up an umbrella for others


# What this project can do：
Help you install python and pycharm, spyder, jupyter three common python editor, install a series of commonly used extension libraries and pycharm plug-ins, automatically adjust some of the requirements of python on the system (such as environment variables), to help you quickly get started with python, with the market with some of the basic textbooks of python can play a better effect.

# How to use this project:
After downloading the project, find PythonHelper.exe and run it.Please make sure that python and pycharm are not installed on your system and that you can grant administrator privileges to this application.If your device is capable of supporting the operation of this project, then the fully automated installation should have already started.

# Difference between this project and anaconda:
1.While the Anaconda installer is relatively large and can take up a lot of disk space, PythonHelper tries to use as little disk space as possible to help you learn python.
2.Anaconda contains a large number of libraries and tools with relatively long startup times, while PythonHelper contains fewer but necessary and useful libraries
3.Anaconda has stringent system requirements, and reinstalling it after an installation error can lead to a lot of trouble. Although PythonHelper faces the same issue, it comes with tools to resolve the troubles.
