# PythonHelper

# Introduction
This is PythonHelper, a project designed to assist Python beginners. Inspired by my own experience of getting caught in the rain while learning Python, I wanted to provide an umbrella of support for others.

# Project Features
PythonHelper can help you with the installation of Python, as well as three common Python editors: PyCharm, Spyder, and Jupyter. It also installs a series of commonly used extension libraries and PyCharm plugins. The project automatically adjusts certain Python system requirements, such as environment variables, to facilitate a quick start with Python. When used in conjunction with some basic Python textbooks available in the market, PythonHelper can enhance the learning experience.

# How to Use
After downloading the project, locate PythonHelper.exe and run it. Please ensure that Python and PyCharm are not already installed on your system. Grant administrator privileges to this application. If your device supports the operation of this project, the fully automated installation process should begin.

# Difference from Anaconda
1. While the Anaconda installer is relatively large and can consume a significant amount of disk space, PythonHelper strives to use minimal disk space to facilitate your Python learning experience.
2. Anaconda includes numerous libraries and tools with relatively long startup times, whereas PythonHelper includes fewer but essential and useful libraries.
3. Anaconda has strict system requirements, and reinstalling it after an installation error can be troublesome. PythonHelper faces similar issues but comes with tools to resolve them.
